## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

Iâ€™m Aravind, AI Engineer at Actalyst (6 years in applied AI + backend), focused on retrieval, agents, and deploying agents for automating workflows.Before Actalyst, I led teams on pricing models at PwC and built optimization models for manufacturing process at Aditya Birla Group. I write about what Iâ€™m learning at **[thoughts.bitsnbytes.in](https://thoughts.bitsnbytes.in/)**.

### Currently exploring

- Retrieval quality (indexing strategies, reranking, evals)
- Agent reliability (stateful planners, tool orchestration)
- Automated Intelligent systems for insights on data
